Preparing your Fork

3. Create a branch: ``cd sql-and-pandas-examples; git checkout -b new-example``.

Making your Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Add your contributions
2. Run tests and make sure they pass. (I intend to use unittest.)
3. Commit your changes: ``git commit -m "Added new feature"`` and please be descriptive with git commits!



Creating Pull Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Push your commit to get it back up to your fork: ``git push origin HEAD``
2. Visit Github, click the handy "Pull request" button that it will make upon
   noticing your new branch.
3. In the description field, write down issue number (if submitting code fixing
   an existing issue) or describe the issue + your fix (if submitting a wholly
   new bugfix).
4. Hit 'submit' and ask for ``sdhutchins`` to review! And please be patient - I will get to you when I can
